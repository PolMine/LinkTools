#' LinkTools-Package
#'
#' This package facilitates the linkage of data sets via shared unique
#' identifiers. Four steps are integrated into this package: a) the preparation
#' of data sets which should be linked, i.e. the transformation into a comparable
#' format and the assignment of shared unique identifiers, b) the merge of
#' data sets based on these identifiers, c) the encoding or enrichment of the
#' data with three output formats (data.table, XML or CWB). In addition, d), the
#' package includes a wrapper for the Named Entity Linking of textual data based
#' on DBpedia Spotlight.

* addressed a quite comprehensive issue in `external_attribute_to_region_matrix()` that potentially obscured speakers which were not matched, making them unavailable for both the fuzzy matching and manual inspection (issue #14)
* introduced tests
* modified vignette, uses GERMAPARLMINI as sample data and the `btmp` package for linking
* removed data and data-raw which were containing the external data now provided by the `btmp` package
* made the addition more robust for subcorpora

[2023-04-12]
* starting rework to address more diverging dataset-text data-combination
* adding the `additional_attributes` argument to `create_attribute_region_datatable()` to make manual inspection more meaningful
* made `check_and_add_missing_values()` more flexible by passing `check_for_groups` as a list and adding the `negate` argument
* added capability to use more than one fuzzy matched variable in `fuzzy_join_missing_values()`
* made more explicit use of fuzzyjoin::stringdist_join()
